# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
The objective of this project was to gather earthquake and techtonic data and create interactive maps of earthquakes around the world. The earthquake data is represented on the map using circle markers and the size of the marker is coorelated to the magnitude of the earthquake. Finally the markers are also color coded and a legend is provided. 

The code for the [HTML](https://github.com/shahkibria/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/Earthquake_Challenge/index.html) page and the underlying [Javascript](https://github.com/shahkibria/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/Earthquake_Challenge/static/js/challenge_logic.js) has been included in the repository. 

# Type of Maps
Our interactive map contains three layers: streets, satellite and dark. On top of these three base layers, the map contains three overlay layers with each overlay containing specific data. They are: earthquakes, techtonic plates and major earthquakes. Our interactive map can present any one of the three base layers at a given time. On top of the base layer, all three interactive layer (or any combination depending on the user's preference) can be displayed. We have included some screenshots below:
